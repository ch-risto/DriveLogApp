## Features
### a) User interface
The app features a user-friendly interface, providing a glimpse into the potential functionality of a complete driving log application. While buttons and styles are visually appealing, the actual logging capability is not fully implemented.

For a consistent aesthetic, we've introduced a 'mystyles.xml' file in the 'values' directory. This file contains style configurations for buttons, ensuring a uniform look and feel. Customize colors and sizes according to your preferences.

The "Add Drive" button opens an activity allowing users to input details such as the selected vehicle and date. Given information will be shown in SavedFragment when pressed Save. However, the app currently lacks the ability to record this information due to its unfinished nature.

Clicking "Save" displays a summary of entered details. Keep in mind that this is a visual representation, and no actual data storage or processing occurs.

A convenient "Back to Main Menu" button lets users navigate back to the main screen effortlessly.
