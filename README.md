## Features
### a) User interface
The app features a user-friendly interface, providing a glimpse into the potential functionality of a complete driving log application. While buttons and styles are visually appealing, the actual logging capability is not fully implemented.

A convenient "Back to Main Menu" button lets users navigate back to the main screen effortlessly.
